`engge2` is an adventure game engine able to run `Thimbleweed Park`.

It's an open source remake of `Thimbleweed Park`'s engine.

It's still a project in active development, and there are a lot of issues, don't hesitate to contribute or to fill out a [bug report](https://github.com/scemino/engge2/issues/new/choose).

## How to play

* Buy [Thimbleweed park](https://thimbleweedpark.com)
* Go to your installation folder and copy these files:  `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack1` and `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack2` to `engge2` directory
* You can also copy your savegames from `Thimbleweed Park`: `Savegame*.save` and `Savegame*.png` (:warning: don't move your files, make a copy)
* You can even keep your achievements by copying the `Save.dat` file
* Ready ? Just type `./engge2`

## Ransome unbeeped DLC, Italian voice over and more

`engge 2` now supports [Ransome unbeeped](https://www.gog.com/game/thimbleweed_park_ransome_unbeeped) and also [Italian voiceover](https://www.gugames.eu/twp_voice.html).

Go to your installation folder and copy these files:  `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack3` to `engge2` directory.

You can even create your own `ggpack` and override the original assets Ã  la [Doom WAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_modding) :wink: 

Rename your `ggpack` `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack3` or `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack4` or `ThimbleweedPark.ggpack5` or ... you get it now :smile:.

## The game says "This is NOT a valid ggpack file"

If it happens, create a file and named it `Prefs.json` and write this content:

```json
{
  "key": "56ad"
}
```

The key value can be one of these values: `"56ad"`, `"566d"`, `"5b6d"`, `"5bad"`.

If it still doesn't work, try another key from above.

## Why engge 2 ?

* [engge](https://github.com/scemino/engge) was a C++ project, during the development I was frustrated by C++, I decided to fix the last bugs by starting from scratch and experimenting a new language: [nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
